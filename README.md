Our goal was to essentially re-create Pacman but through Java. We did this by primarily using
jButtons, imageIcons, and a jFrame. Everything else is backend development to allow unique
functions to be properly utilized. 

Our goals for this project was to first, create a map similar to Pacman, then populate it with a 
controllable character (Pacman) and enemies (Ghosts). The goal is for the player to run around
and collect all of the orbs scattered throughout the map. Once the player does this, the game ends. 
However, if the player is caught by a non-vulnerable ghost, the game also ends. 

We wanted the enemies to move around spiratically, only because we have no idea how to code 
artificial intelligence to allow the enemies to actively chase Pacman. We also wanted to implement 
a function allowing Pacman to always be moving unless he runs into a wall, in which case he would 
simply stay still, until the player issues another direction to move. We also implemented a function
where as the game goes on, the enemies and Pacman move slightly faster and faster. If you leave the
game running, everything will be zooming around the map at light speed! This makes the game
slightly more challenging, where even though the player can move faster, the enemies moves become
completely untamed and the player is completely unable to anticipate the direction they will move in.
Finally, we coded an additional function allowing the player to chase and kill the enemies, making
them reset in the middle of the map.

We also made the game much more visually pleasing by creating vectorized models for the player,
enemies, vulnerable enemies, orbs, and super orbs. 

(If we had more time we would have implemented lives, levels, power-ups, starting and game over 
GUI screens, a multiplayer mode, an updated map, unique enemy abilities, etc. But we are incredibly
satisfied with our product for working on it within a week!)
